# dynamodb-utility

This utility script helps perform tasks related to migrating DynamoDB tables across AWS accounts. It exports DynamoDB table configurations (excluding the data) and re-create those tables in another AWS account. It also helps enable PITR, create S3 exports and setup corresponding Glue jobs for each table.

* IAM user/role with the following permissions to execute the script:
    * dynamodb:CreateTables (in destination account)
    * dynamodb:DescribeTable (in source account)
    * dynamodb:ExportTableToPointInTime (in source account)
    * dynamodb:ListTables (in both accounts)

    * dynamodb:UpdateTable (in source account)
